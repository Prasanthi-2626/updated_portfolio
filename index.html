            <p>Hello! Exploring the intersection of technology and design, I'm immersed in my fourth year of B.Tech at the Kakinada Institute of Engineering and Technology. Specializing in AI&DS, I find every opportunity to integrate my learning into real-life projects exciting. ðŸš€
                My current adventure involves both aspects of development and design as a UI/UX enthusiast and as a web developer. These roles challenge me to not only think creatively but also ensure functionality and user engagement.
                As part of my hands-on experience, I am currently interning as a Junior Developer at K-Hub, mentored through IIIT-Hyderabad, where I work on innovative projects that hone my developmental skills.
                Looking to discuss the latest in tech or UI/UX trends? Hit the connect button! Iâ€™m always up for a lively chat or a collaborative project! ðŸŒŸ</p>
